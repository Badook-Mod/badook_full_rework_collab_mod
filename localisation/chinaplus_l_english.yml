With the fall of the Ming Dynasty many of the measures used to keep the River in check have fallen into disrepear. This has culminated in the largest flood ever recorded by scribes, the social consequences will be far reaching as many flee the populous region to escape oncoming tides."

 mandate_events.4.t:0 "Refugees mass exodus from the Yellow River"

 mandate_events.5.t:0 "Peasants form raiding parties"
 mandate_events.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, the consequences from the flood have arrived sooner than expected. A group of peasants have begun pillaging the countryside, and possibly drawn bandits to our lands.

 mandate_events.5.a:0 "Here they come!"
 
 mandate_events.6.t:0 "The Yellow Turbans Rise"
 mandate_events.6.d:0 "Our neglect of the peasants has lead to a mass uprising of the Yellow Turbans in central china, a small religious sect following a branch of Confucianism, has now grown to a massive organisation, and have siezed control of many of the central provinces. Faith in the emperor is low and this rebellion MUST be crushed for china to prosper once more!"
